  Paths, routes, and parcours cross and intertwine, as visitors follow in the footsteps of Annemarie and Lucius Burckhardt (1930–2012; 1925–2003) and their method of strollology. The practice of these two unconventional thinkers affiliated with Kassel's town and landscape planning has been a point of departure to think about the act of walking. Joining a member of the documenta 14 Chorus, visitors can create their own lines of enquiry, questioning and entering into dialogue as they unravel and unfold documenta 14 together.
