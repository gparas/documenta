  Paths, routes, and parcours cross and intertwine, as visitors follow in the footsteps of Annemarie and Lucius Burckhardt (1930–2012; 1925–2003) and their method of strollology. The practice of these two unconventional thinkers affiliated with the Kassel's town and landscape planning has been a point of departure to think about the act of walking. Joining a member of the documenta 14 Athens Chorus, visitors can create their own lines of enquiry, questioning and entering into dialogue as they unravel and unfold documenta 14 together.

  The Athens School of Fine Arts has evolved from a small nucleus established in 1837 and within a few years it was organised into three divisions under a single director. The third division of the school, which taught painting, sculpture, architecture, lithography, woodcutting, geometry, and cartography among other disciplines, was the real ancestor of today's School and the predominant branch of the School for the Arts from 1844 until 1862. The school's second division, the School of Industrial Arts, was developed into the Technical University, which, since 1863, has become a very important factor in Greece's industrial development.
</p>

<p>
  <br>
  In 1910 the School was separated from the Technical University and provided with its own director until, in 1930, as the Athens School of Fine Arts was established as an independent institution. The administration offices of the Athens School of Fine Arts, the Typography studio and the ASFA Press remain at the school's old headquarters at 42 Patision Street, but in 1992 all other departments moved to new premises at 256 Peiraios Street. The new building formerly housed the Sikiarides family textile factory. It is a fine example of mid-20th century industrial architecture and was carefully renovated.

  The new Benaki Museum building is located at 138 Pireos Street, one of the central development axes of Athens. The architectural renovation preserved the initial building plan and added an additional floor. The general principles of the design were based on the idea of an inward-facing building with openings towards the central courtyard. Movement through the exhibition halls is designed to take place around the perimeter of the courtyard, in such a way as to ensure maximum visibility for the visitor and flexibility in the utilisation of space. The atrium/courtyard area, a basic feature of the activities taking place there, can host outdoor exhibitions, musical events and performances. The bookshop and restaurant open onto the courtyard at the ground level.

  The Athens Conservatoire (Greek: ωδείο Αθηνών) is the oldest conservatoire in modern Greece. It was founded in 1871 by the Athens Music and Drama Society. Initially, the musical instruments that were taught there were limited to the violin and the flute, representative of the ancient Greek Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles. Significantly, piano lessons were not included in the program. In 1881 its new German-taught director Georgios Nazos, in a move that was controversial at the time, expanded the conservatoire's program by introducing modern Western European-style instruments and theory material. Among the musicians who have taught at the Athens Consevatoire are Constantine Psachos, Manolis Kalomiris, Felix Petyrek, Elvira de Hidalgo. Notables who were taught at Athens Consevatoire include Spyridon Samaras (1875–1882), Maria Callas (1938), Dimitri Mitropoulos (1919), Nikos Skalkottas (graduated 1920), Gina Bachauer (graduated 1929), Mikis Theodorakis, Dimitris Sgouros, Loukas Karytinos.
