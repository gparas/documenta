Paths, routes, and parcours cross and intertwine, as visitors consider the pathways taken by peripatetic thinkers as a point of departure for a reflection on the act of walking. Joining a member of the documenta 14 Chorus, visitors can create their own lines of inquiry, questioning and entering into dialogue as they unravel and unfold documenta 14 together.

The exhibition hall of the Athens School of Fine Art provides a fitting setting for exploring notions of experimental education and pedagogy, such as the “open form” or “open city.” Encompassing the garden as a space for learning, the walks with the Chorus take on a reflective nature. Among the garden’s student-made sculptures, rose bushes, pomegranate, and fig trees is a walnut tree called the Otto Tree, named after the King of Greece who brought it from Bavaria.

The architects of the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens (EMST), Takis Zenetos and Margaritis Apostolidis, developed a flexible design capable of adapting to future uses and different circumstances. The building’s original function as a brewery for “Fix” beer with its now silenced machines, is replaced by the documenta 14 Chorus, a multitude of voices and bodies drawn together for listening and dialogue, while experiencing the works of documenta 14. The Chorus of document 14 open up lines of inquiry and weaves connecting threads between the large number of artists exhibited.

The walks explore the relationship between score, voice, sound, and performance as found in the practices of documenta 14 artists. The walks focus on contemporary artists who are interested in the intersection of movement, rhythm, music, and performance. They employ scores and musical instruments that are deeply engaged with everyday life and social reality. How do we read scores collectively and interact in the face of displacement and unrelenting instability? How can the human voice express an object’s ancestry and its sound vibrations?
